                <p id="pg1p1">As I look out of my window this morning, I see the landscape I have learned to love here
                    on Rapa Nui, which is known in some places by the name Easter Island. The grasses and shrubs are
                    green, the sky is blue, and the old, now extinct volcanoes rise up in the background.</p>
                <p id="pg1p2">I am a bit sad knowing that this is my last week on the island. I have finished my field
                    work and will be returning home. Later today, I will take a walk through the hills and say good-bye
                    to the moai that I have been studying for the past nine months. Here is a picture of some of these
                    massive statues.</p>

                <img src="images/EasterIsland.jpg" id="img3" alt="">

                <p id="pg1p3">If you have been following my blog this year, then you know that the people of Rapa Nui
                    carved these moai hundreds of years ago. These impressive moai had been carved in a single quarry on
                    the eastern part of the island. Some of them weighed thousands of kilos, yet the people of Rapa Nui
                    were able to move them to locations far away from the quarry without cranes or any heavy equipment.
                </p>

                <p id="pg1p4">For years, archeologists did not know how these massive statues were moved. It remained a
                    mystery until the 1990s, when a team of archeologists and residents of Rapa Nui demonstrated that
                    the moai could have been transported and raised using ropes made from plants and wooden rollers and
                    tracks made from large trees that had once thrived on the island. The mystery of the moai was
                    solved. </p>

                <p id="pg1p5">Another mystery remained, however. What happened to these plants and large trees that had
                    been used to move the moai? As I said, when I look out of my window, I see grasses and shrubs and a
                    small tree or two, but nothing that could have been used to move these huge statues. It is a
                    fascinating puzzle, one that I will explore in future posts and lectures. Until then, you may wish
                    to investigate the mystery yourself. I suggest you begin with a book called <i>Collapse</i> by Jared
                    Diamond.

                        I also love reading about your experiences on Easter Island, however, I think there is another
                        theory that should be considered. Check out this article: <a id="newsLink" class="tabLink"
