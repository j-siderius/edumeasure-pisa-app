        <p>Fish are cold-blooded animals that live in water and have gills to breathe.
            They come in many shapes, sizes, and colors, and can be found in oceans, lakes, and rivers all over the
            world.
            Most fish swim by moving their tails back and forth, and they use fins to steer and keep balance in the
            water.</p>

        <p>Birds are warm-blooded animals that typically have feathers and beaks. 
            Most birds are known for their ability to fly, which they do using strong wings and lightweight bones. 
            They lay eggs in nests—small, cozy structures often built in trees or on the ground—to keep their eggs safe until they hatch.</p>
